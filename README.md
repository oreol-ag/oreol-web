  * What is Hyperion? Hyperion is an out-of-the-box heterogenous acceleration platform comprising power-efficient servers, (integrating) state-of-the-art (pioneering) acceleration devices (such as ACAPs, FPGAs, multi-core CPUs, and GPUs), and a self-made runtime and API to manage and program them. 
  * For what and for whom is Hyperion made? Hyperion is conceived (engineered) to facilitate the work of super-computing experts architecturing their complex acceleration applications. Highly-specialized acceleration engineers are usually working for research institutions or universities that benefit from having on-site hardware for development, testing, and stagingâ€”just before going on production.
  * In the cloud? No! Hyperion is meant to be an on-site resource for edge-computing. However, we offer a few instances on the cloud for users to test it.
  * How can I start using Hyperion? We offer a few Hyperion instances on the cloud for evaluation purposes. Sign in here and try it for free, forever!
  * How can I buy Hyperion? To buy Hyperion instances, please fill up this form and our sales department will come back to you shortly.
  * What is HRT?
  * How can I start using HRT?
  * Is HRT free? Yes! We develope it together with the ETH Systems group (JDA) and is offered as open-source.
