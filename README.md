  * What we do ===> Hyperion HRT
    * We are a leading company in advanced computing technologies, specializing in state-of-the-art acceleration systems based on heterogeneous computing, and best known for creating Hyperionâ€”a computing platform that streamlines the development of complex acceleration applications using advanced servers, accelerators, and software.
  * What we stand for
    * Walk the walk. Your actions matter, and you can inspire people. Your behavior sets the tone, influencing others to follow the values and principles you embody.
    * Be honest. Practicing honesty and open communication are crucial. Making your actions transparent enhances collaboration and enables timely problem-solving.
    * We trust you. Follow your instincts: your intuition and judgment are valued assets that can lead to innovative solutions and confident decision-making.
    * Quality over quantity. Prioritize creating fewer, exceptional things that resonate, rather than churning out a multitude of mediocrity.
    * You are an artist. Beauty is not confined to the realm of art alone; it transcends into our everyday tasks and work. Everything we do must not only function but also be beautiful.
  * [Vocabulary](./vocabulary.md)
    * Heterogeneous computing is the practice of utilizing a combination of different computing devices, such as ACAPs, FPGAs, multi-core CPUs, and GPUs, concurrently to leverage the unique capabilities of each accelerator. This strategy results in improved overall performance and efficiency when compared to relying solely on a single type of device. Heterogeneous computing enables a system to efficiently manage a wide variety of applications and tailor performance optimization for each specific task. It is a growing trend, particularly in fields such as artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and high-performance computing.

  * What is Hyperion? Hyperion is an out-of-the-box heterogeneous acceleration platform, featuring energy-efficient servers, advanced acceleration devices such as ACAPs, FPGAs, multi-core CPUs, and GPUs, along with a tailored RunTime and API for their management and programming.
  * What is Hyperion designed for, and who is it intended for? Hyperion is created to simplify the process of developing complex acceleration applications, primarily serving highly specialized acceleration engineers working at research institutions or universities. These engineers typically benefit from dedicated hardware for development, testing, and staging before transitioning to production.
  * Is Hyperion hosted in the public cloud? No, Hyperion is designed to be an on-premises resource for edge computing. However, you have the option to build your private cloud using Hyperion servers and offer your accelerated services by exposing them.
  * How can I begin using Hyperion? You can get started by trying out a few Hyperion instances available in the public cloud for free evaluation. Simply sign in here to give it a try.
  * How can I purchase Hyperion? To obtain Hyperion instances, please complete this form, and our sales department will reach out to you shortly.
  * How are my Hyperion instances maintained? Hyperion is a managed platform, allowing Oreol to provide remote support for keeping your Hyperion instances healthy and your acceleration devices up to date.
  * What is HRT? HRT is the RunTime that a Hyperion instance uses to efficiently manage and interact with its acceleration devices. Additionally, HRT assists Hyperion users in creating new accelerated applications by providing an API for basic operations like data transfer and scheduling. Please refer to the [About HRT](https://github.com/oreol-ag/oreol-web/blob/main/about-hrt.md#about-hrt) section to learn how to use it on servers other than Hyperion.
  * Does Oreol offer consulting for developing my accelerated applications? No, Oreol focuses on configuring your Hyperion instances to meet your application's specific needs, rather than assisting with application development.
