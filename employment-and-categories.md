We provide a stable and supportive work environment. Our employment structure and **Mastery Path categories** reflect our commitment to promote growth and development among our employees. This section outlines the various employment types, career progression opportunities, and the criteria that distinguish each level within our organization.

## Employment types.
We currently offer **full-time employment** to our workforce, which emphasizes stability and a comprehensive benefits package. Full-time employees are essential to our organization's success, and we are committed to providing a supportive and rewarding work experience.

## Categories.
Within every job function, we've established a **Mastery Path with five categories,** ranging from junior to lead roles. This framework offers employees clear and achievable career progression, ensuring that individuals have the opportunity to grow and excel within their roles.

## Making a career.

We are committed to providing support and opportunities for career development. Employees are encouraged to engage in professional growth and to actively work towards progressing along the **Mastery Path,** by taking this into account: 

* **Uniform job titles:** We maintain uniform job titles across all departments to simplify our organization's structure and foster consistency. This approach allows employees to easily understand their roles within the company.

* **Distinct criteria:** While job titles are uniform, the precise criteria distinguishing each level from one another vary. It's essential for employees to be aware of their specific category, including the responsibilities and benefits it entails. Understanding these distinctions is key to fostering a positive and productive working experience.

We remain adaptable to future employment policy changes, ensuring a dynamic and supportive work environment for our valued employees. Our commitment to adaptability and growth is integral to our organizational culture.
