# Employment and categories

We currently offer full-time employment to our workforce, emphasizing stability and a comprehensive benefits package. We remain adaptable to future employment policy changes, ensuring a dynamic and supportive work environment for our valued employees. 

## Categories
Within every job function, we've defined a [Mastery Path](./mastery-path.md) with five levels, ranging from junior to lead roles. Although the titles remain uniform across all departments, the precise criteria distinguishing each level from one to another are different.

Each employment category at Oreol comes with its own set of benefits and responsibilities. It's essential for employees to be aware of their specific category and what it entails, ensuring a positive working experience for everyone.
