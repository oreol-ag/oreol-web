We currently offer full-time employment to our workforce, emphasizing stability and a comprehensive benefits package. We remain adaptable to future employment policy changes, ensuring a dynamic and supportive work environment for our valued employees. 

## Working hours
We use the annual working time model for its employees. When operational needs permit, this model allows for flexibility and working conditions that can be adapted to the personal needs of our employees. **The standard working hours for full-â€‹time employees are 41 hours per week.**

## Holidays
Oreol employees receive five weeks of annual holiday, which must be taken within the same year. They can carry over up to two weeks into the next year, but these days should be used by March 31st. The timing of holidays should be coordinated with supervisors based on operational requirements.

## Over-hours and overtime
Over-hours are extra hours worked beyond the legal limit of 45 hours per week. Employees should try to balance these by taking equivalent time off throughout the year. If it's not possible due to work needs, up to 100 hours can be carried over to the next year, and another 100 hours can be paid out. Excess hours beyond this limit will not carry over or be compensated.

## Categories
Within every job function, we've defined a **Mastery Path with five categories,** ranging from junior to lead roles. Although the titles remain uniform across all departments, the precise criteria distinguishing each level from one to another are different. It's essential for employees to be aware of their specific category, including the responsibilities and benefits it entails, to ensure a positive working experience for everyone.
