# Benefits

## Holidays
Oreol employees receive five weeks of annual holiday, which must be taken within the same year. They can carry over up to two weeks into the next year, but these days should be used by March 31st. The timing of holidays should be coordinated with supervisors based on operational requirements.

## Over-hours and overtime
Over-hours are extra hours worked beyond the legal limit of 45 hours per week. Employees should try to balance these by taking equivalent time off throughout the year. If it's not possible due to work needs, up to 100 hours can be carried over to the next year, and another 100 hours can be paid out. Excess hours beyond this limit will not carry over or be compensated.
