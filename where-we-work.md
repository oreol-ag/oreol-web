At *Oreol,* we prioritize employee flexibility and **support remote work.** Our employees have two primary options:

## From home.
The majority of our team members at *Oreol* choose to work from home for the majority of their work time. We understand the importance of a comfortable and efficient home office setup, which is why we offer a generous allowance during your first year with us. This allowance can be used to equip and personalize your home office to meet your needs.
    
## From a coworking space.
For those who prefer a different workspace or find working from home less suitable, we also offer the option of working from a coworking space. Oreol provides a resonable stipend per month to support your desk rental in a coworking environment.
