# Where we work

We prioritize employee flexibility, ensuring you work in your preferred environment.

## From home
The majority of our team members at Oreol choose to work from home for the majority of their work time. We understand the importance of a comfortable and efficient home office setup, which is why we offer a generous allowance of up to CHF 1,500 during your first year with us. This allowance can be used to equip and personalize your home office to meet your needs.
    
## From a coworking space
For those who prefer a different workspace or find working from home less suitable, we also offer the option of working from a coworking space. Oreol provides a stipend of CHF 200 per month to support your desk rental in a coworking environment.
