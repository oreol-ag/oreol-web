## Executive team.
* **Dr. Javier Moya, *Oreol's* CEO and founder,** is a visionary in heterogeneous computing. He played a pivotal role in developing cutting-edge technology platforms based on IBM's DOME MicroDataCenter and cloudFPGA. At ETH Zurich's Systems Group, Javier led the rebuilding of the ETHZ Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster (ETHZ-HACC) and developed the Systems Group RunTime for device management. His innovation culminated in Oreol's first product, Hyperion, an on-premises acceleration platform that empowers specialized acceleration engineers with efficient device management and application development.

## Product evolution.

### cloudFPGA.
As the CTO and Head of Product at DC-ONE AG (later known as GRAPIN AG), Javier held the responsibility of spearheading the development of a cutting-edge technology platform for **heterogeneous computing.** This platform was built upon IBM's Research Europe Zurich DOME MicroDataCenter and **cloudFPGA** high-performance computing platforms.

### Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster.
In 2021, Javier joined **Prof. Dr. Gustavo Alonso**'s research team at the **Systems Group, ETH Zurich (ETHZ).** During the first two years of his engagement at ETH, Javier took on the ambitious project of completely rebuilding the **ETHZ Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster (ETHZ-HACC).** Such a cluster one of the five HACCs established as part of the **AMD University Program,** distributed across some of the world's most prestigious universities.

### Systems Group RunTime.
With the ETHZ-HACC expanding in terms of both server count and the variety of accelerators, from FPGAs to ACAPs, FPGAs, multi-core GPUs, and GPUs, the management of this diverse range of devices and the deployment of accelerated applications became increasingly challenging. To address these challenges, Javier developed the **Systems Group RunTime,** a unified software suite including a CLI and API. For more comprehensive information, please visit **GitHub’s SGRT repository** at https://github.com/fpgasystems/sgrt.

### Hyperion.
*Oreol’s* first product, **Hyperion, is an on-premises acceleration platform that combines energy-efficient servers with advanced acceleration devices like ACAPs, FPGAs, CPUs, and GPUs.** Designed for specialized acceleration engineers in research institutions, Hyperion provides a tailored command-line interpreter (CLI) and API, packaged as Hyperion RunTime (HRT), for efficient device management and application development.
