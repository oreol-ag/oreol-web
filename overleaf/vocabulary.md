## Heterogenous computing
Heterogeneous computing refers to using multiple processing units (such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ACAPs) to leverage the unique strengths of each type of processing unit to achieve better performance and efficiency than would be possible with a single kind of unit alone. By combining multiple processing units with different architectures and capabilities, a heterogeneous computing system can handle a broader range of workloads and optimize performance for each task. Heterogeneous computing is becoming increasingly popular in fields like artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and high-performance computing.
