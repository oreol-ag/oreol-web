We work on Basecamp, in small teams, shaping up every six weeks, and practicing clear communication.

## On Basecamp.
We use Basecamp (an all-in-one project management platform) to develop our projects, communicate, and operate the company.

## In small teams.
You can do big things with small teams, but it’s hard to do small things with big teams. And small is often plenty. That’s the power of small — you do what needs to be done rather than overdoing it.

## Shaping up every six weeks.
Shape Up is a development framework employing a unique product development approach with six-week cycles. During these cycles, teams work on projects with fixed timelines and flexible scopes, allowing for better focus and resource management. If a project isn't completed within the six weeks, it's considered a failure, and teams move on, maintaining a work-life balance without over hours.

## Practicing clear communication.
Few things are as important to study, practice, and perfect as clear communication. **Poor communication creates more work and we embrace these principles to avoid that:**

* Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time.

* Internal communication based on long-form writing, rather than a verbal tradition of meetings, speaking, and chatting, leads to a welcomed reduction in meetings, video conferences, calls, or other real-time opportunities to interrupt and be interrupted.

* Give meaningful discussions a meaningful amount of time to develop and unfold. Rushing to judgement, or demanding immediate responses, only serves to increase the odds of poor decision making.

* Meetings are the last resort, not the first option. Five people in a room for an hour isn’t a one hour meeting, it’s a five hour meeting. How often was it worth that? Could you have just written it up instead? Be mindful of the costs and tradeoffs.

* Writing solidifies, chat dissolves. Substantial decisions start and end with an exchange of complete thoughts, not one-line-at-a-time jousts. If it’s important, critical, or fundamental, write it up, don’t chat it down.

* Speaking only helps who’s in the room, writing helps everyone. This includes people who couldn’t make it, or future employees who join years from now.

* Never expect or require someone to get back to you immediately unless it’s a true emergency. The expectation of immediate response is toxic.

* Urgency is overrated, ASAP is poison.

* If something’s going to be difficult to hear or share, invite questions at the end. Ending without the invitation will lead to public silence but private conjecture. This is where rumors breed.

* The end of the day has a way of convincing you what you’ve done is good, but the next morning has a way of telling you the truth. If you aren’t sure, sleep on it before saying it.
