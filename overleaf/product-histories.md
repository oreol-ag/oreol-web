## cloudFPGA
As the CTO and Head of Product at DC-ONE AG (later known as GRAPIN AG), Javier held the responsibility of spearheading the development of a cutting-edge technology platform for heterogeneous computing. This platform was built upon IBM's Research Europe Zurich DOME MicroDataCenter and cloudFPGA high-performance computing platforms. To get to know more, please follow this link.

## Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster
In 2021, Javier joined Prof. Dr. Gustavo Alonso's research team at the Systems Group, ETH Zurich (ETHZ). During the first two years of his engagement at ETH, Javier took on the ambitious project of completely rebuilding the ETHZ Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster (ETH-HACC). Such a cluster one of the five HACCs established as part of the AMD University Program, distributed across some of the world's most prestigious universities. For additional details, please visit GitHub’s Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster repository.

## Systems Group RunTime
With the ETHZ-HACC expanding in terms of both server count and the variety of accelerators, from FPGAs to ACAPs, FPGAs, multi-core GPUs, and GPUs, the management of this diverse range of devices and the deployment of accelerated applications became increasingly challenging. To address these challenges, Javier developed the **Systems Group RunTime,** a unified software suite including a CLI and API. For more comprehensive information, please visit GitHub’s SGRT repository.

## Hyperion
Oreol’s first product, Hyperion, is an on-premises acceleration platform that combines energy-efficient servers with advanced acceleration devices like ACAPs, FPGAs, CPUs, and GPUs. Designed for specialized acceleration engineers in research institutions, Hyperion provides a tailored command-line interpreter (CLI) and API, packaged as Hyperion RunTime (HRT), for efficient device management and application development.
