# Benefits

## Holidays
Oreol employees receive five weeks of annual holiday, which must be taken within the same year. They can carry over up to two weeks into the next year, but these days should be used by March 31st. The timing of holidays should be coordinated with supervisors based on operational requirements.

## Over-hours and overtime
Over-hours are extra hours worked beyond the legal limit of 45 hours per week. Employees should try to balance these by taking equivalent time off throughout the year. If it's not possible due to work needs, up to 100 hours can be carried over to the next year, and another 100 hours can be paid out. Excess hours beyond this limit will not carry over or be compensated.

## Performance bonus
Excellent work by employees can be rewarded financially with a performance bonus. This kind of one-â€‹off, direct recognition is reserved for outstanding work. You can find more information on the Performance Bonus information sheet.

## Continuous education
We believe in the importance of continuous learning and skill enhancement. To support our employees' professional growth, we offer funding opportunities for courses and training programs aimed at improving their skills and expertise.

## Accounts
As an Oreol employee, you'll receive a comprehensive set of accounts to support your work and financial needs. This includes a Basecamp account for project management, a HEY email account, a Dropbox account for file management, and a Revolut account for secure and convenient payment processing. 

## Active Lifestyle Support
We value your well-being and encourage an active lifestyle. We're committed to helping you stay fit and healthy. That's why we're happy to cover half the cost of your sports subscription, whether it's for CrossFit, yoga, or any other sports discipline you're passionate about.
