Oreol provides its employees with stimulating work and an excellent work-life balance, expecting them in return to deliver outstanding performance.

## Compensation

We maintain a **uniform salary structure** for employees in the same position, regardless of their work location. We are fully dedicated to promoting fairness and equality in our compensation practices, and your salary will be determined by your **category within the Mastery Path.** The salary baselines adhere to the **Swiss Federal Personnel** Act and the Canton of Lucerne Personnel Ordinance.

## Benefits

Our comprehensive benefits package is designed to support your physical and financial health, ensuring you have access to a range of valuable perks and resources to enhance your overall quality of life.

### Paid time off

* **Vacation time:** Oreol employees receive **five weeks of annual holiday,** which must be taken within the same year. They can carry over up to two weeks into the next year, but these days should be used by March 31st. The timing of holidays should be coordinated with supervisors based on operational requirements.

* **Sick time:** We maintain a flexible approach to sick time that prioritizes your well-being. We don't operate with a formal bank of sick days, nor do we require you to keep track of your sick days. However if you’re unexpectedly away from work due to illness or injury for more than 5 consecutive work days, you’ll transition from sick time to Personal Leave. Your manager will check in with you if you’re consistently taking 3+ unplanned sick days per month. **Excessive use of sick time may result in disciplinary measures.**

* **Personal leave:** If you are unable to work due to illness or injury for more than one week, please promptly notify your manager. You can take four weeks off at full pay, followed by eight weeks at 70% pay. After 12 weeks, we'll discuss your situation on a case-by-case basis.  In some cases, you may be required to provide medical documentation to support your request. It's important to note that Personal Leave is limited to one instance of paid leave within a 12-month period.

* **Summer hours:** Every year from May 1 through August 31, we implement a 4-day work week. To be eligible, new employees may need to complete a training program as advised by their team lead. If a holiday falls during summer hours, you can choose to take the holiday off or your regular summer day off. Any additional days off beyond this would be considered vacation days.

### Employee profit sharing
Oreol shares 10\% of its annual company profits with employees, which is distributed in shares based on tenure. Profits are distributed after the books are closed on the previous fiscal year, typically around March (e.g., 2023 profits distributed in March 2024). You’re eligible to participate in profit sharing after two years of working at Oreol.

### Continuous education
We believe in the importance of continuous learning and skill enhancement. To support our employees' professional growth, we offer funding opportunities for courses and training programs aimed at improving their skills and expertise.

### Personal accounts
As an Oreol employee, you'll receive a comprehensive set of accounts to support your work and financial needs. This includes a free personal Basecamp account for project management, a free personal HEY email account, and a Dropbox account for file management. 

Additionally, you will receive a Revolut Business card that you can use for work expenses for software, computer equipment, meet-up travel, or office supplies.

### Active Lifestyle Support
We value your well-being and encourage an active lifestyle. We're committed to helping you stay fit and healthy. That's why we're happy to cover half the cost of your sports subscription, whether it's for CrossFit, yoga, or any other sports discipline you're passionate about.
