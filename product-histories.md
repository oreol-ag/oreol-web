## cloudFPGA
As the CTO and Head of Product at DC-ONE AG (later known as GRAPIN AG), Javier held the responsibility of spearheading the development of a cutting-edge technology platform for heterogeneous computing. This platform was built upon IBM's Research Europe Zurich [DOME MicroDataCenter](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/microserver/) and [cloudFPGA](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/cci/cloudFPGA/) high-performance computing platforms.

## Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster
In 2021, Javier joined [Prof. Dr. Gustavo Alonso](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/alonso/)'s research team at the [Systems Group,](https://systems.ethz.ch/) [ETH Zurich (ETHZ).](https://ethz.ch/en.html) During the first two years of his engagement at ETH, Javier took on the ambitious project of completely rebuilding the ETHZ Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster (ETH-HACC). Such a cluster one of the five HACCs established as part of the AMD University Program, distributed across some of the world's most prestigious universities. For additional details, please visit GitHub’s [Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster](https://github.com/fpgasystems/hacc) repository.

## Systems Group RunTime
With the ETHZ-HACC expanding in terms of both server count and the variety of accelerators, from FPGAs to ACAPs, FPGAs, multi-core GPUs, and GPUs, the management of this diverse range of devices and the deployment of accelerated applications became increasingly challenging. To address these challenges, Javier developed the **Systems Group RunTime,** a unified software suite including a CLI and API. For more comprehensive information, please visit GitHub’s [SGRT](https://github.com/fpgasystems/sgrt) repository.

## Hyperion
Oreol’s first product, Hyperion, is an on-premises acceleration platform that combines energy-efficient servers with advanced acceleration devices like ACAPs, FPGAs, CPUs, and GPUs. Designed for specialized acceleration engineers in research institutions, Hyperion provides a tailored command-line interpreter (CLI) and API, packaged as Hyperion RunTime (HRT), for efficient device management and application development.
