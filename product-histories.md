# Product histories

The following projects directly influenced the engineering of Hyperion:

## cloudFPGA
As the CTO and Head of Product at DC-ONE AG (later known as GRAPIN AG), Javier held the responsibility of spearheading the development of a cutting-edge technology platform for heterogeneous computing. This platform was built upon IBM's Research Europe Zurich [DOME MicroDataCenter](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/microserver/) and [cloudFPGA](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/cci/cloudFPGA/) high-performance computing platforms.

## Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster
In 2021, Javier joined Prof. Dr. Gustavo Alonso's research team at the Systems Group, ETH Zurich (ETHZ). During the first two years of our engagement at ETH, Javier took on the ambitious project of completely rebuilding the ETHZ Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster. This cluster was one of the five HACCs established as part of the AMD University Program, distributed across some of the world's most prestigious universities. For additional details, please visit GitHub’s [HACC](https://github.com/fpgasystems/hacc) repository.

## Systems Group RunTime
With the HACC expanding in terms of both server count and the variety of accelerators, from FPGAs to ACAPs, FPGAs, multi-core GPUs, and GPUs, the management of this diverse range of devices and the deployment of accelerated applications became increasingly challenging. To address these challenges, Javier introduced the Systems Group RunTime, unified software suite including a CLI and API.
