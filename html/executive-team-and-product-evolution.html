<li><strong>Dr. Javier Moya, <em>Oreol’s</em> CEO and founder,</strong>
is a visionary in heterogeneous computing. He played a pivotal role in
developing cutting-edge technology platforms based on IBM’s DOME
MicroDataCenter and cloudFPGA. At ETH Zurich’s Systems Group, Javier led
the rebuilding of the ETHZ Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster
(ETHZ-HACC) and developed the Systems Group RunTime for device
management. His innovation culminated in <em>Oreol’s</em> first product,
Hyperion, an on-premises acceleration platform that empowers specialized
acceleration engineers with efficient device management and application
development.</li>

<p>As the CTO and Head of Product at DC-ONE AG (later known as GRAPIN
AG), Javier held the responsibility of spearheading the development of a
cutting-edge technology platform for <strong>heterogeneous
computing.</strong> This platform was built upon IBM’s Research Europe
Zurich DOME MicroDataCenter and <strong>cloudFPGA</strong>
high-performance computing platforms. To get to know more, please visit

<p>In 2021, Javier joined <strong>Prof. Dr. Gustavo Alonso’s</strong>
research team at the <strong>Systems Group, ETH Zurich (ETHZ).</strong>
During the first two years of his engagement at ETH, Javier took on the
ambitious project of completely rebuilding the <strong>ETHZ
Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster (ETHZ-HACC).</strong></p>
<p>Such a cluster is one of the five HACCs established as part of the
<strong>AMD University Program,</strong> distributed across some of the
world’s most prestigious universities. For additional details, please

<p><strong>With the ETHZ-HACC expanding</strong> in terms of both server
count and the variety of accelerators, from FPGAs to ACAPs, FPGAs,
multi-core GPUs, and GPUs, the management of this diverse range of
devices and the deployment of accelerated applications became
<strong>increasingly challenging.</strong></p>
<p>To address these challenges, Javier developed the <strong>Systems
Group RunTime,</strong> a unified software suite including a CLI and
API. For more comprehensive information, please visit:</p>

<p><em>Oreol’s</em> first product, <strong>Hyperion, is an on-premises
acceleration platform that combines energy-efficient servers with
advanced acceleration devices like ACAPs, FPGAs, CPUs, and
GPUs.</strong> Designed for specialized acceleration engineers in
research institutions, Hyperion provides a tailored command-line
interpreter (CLI) and API, packaged as Hyperion RunTime (HRT), for
efficient device management and application development.</p>
