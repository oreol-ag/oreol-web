<p>We work on Basecamp, in small teams, shaping up every six weeks, and
practicing clear communication.</p>
<h2 id="on-basecamp.">On Basecamp.</h2>
<p>We use Basecamp (an all-in-one project management platform) to
develop our projects, communicate, and operate the company.</p>
<h2 id="in-small-teams.">In small teams.</h2>
<p>You can do big things with small teams, but it’s hard to do small
things with big teams. And small is often plenty. That’s the power of
small — you do what needs to be done rather than overdoing it.</p>
<h2 id="shaping-up-every-six-weeks.">Shaping up every six weeks.</h2>
<p>Shape Up is a development framework employing a unique product
development approach with <strong>six-week cycles.</strong> During these
cycles, teams work on projects with fixed timelines and flexible scopes,
allowing for better focus and resource management.</p>
<p>If a project isn’t completed within the six weeks, it’s considered a
failure, and teams move on, <strong>maintaining a work-life balance
without over hours.</strong></p>
<h2 id="practicing-clear-communication.">Practicing clear
communication.</h2>
<p>Few things are as important to study, practice, and perfect as clear
communication. <strong>Poor communication creates more work and we
embrace these principles to avoid that:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time.</p></li>
<li><p>Internal communication based on long-form writing, rather than a
verbal tradition of meetings, speaking, and chatting, leads to a
welcomed reduction in meetings, video conferences, calls, or other
real-time opportunities to interrupt and be interrupted.</p></li>
<li><p>Give meaningful discussions a meaningful amount of time to
develop and unfold. Rushing to judgement, or demanding immediate
responses, only serves to increase the odds of poor decision
making.</p></li>
<li><p>Meetings are the last resort, not the first option. Five people
in a room for an hour isn’t a one hour meeting, it’s a five hour
meeting. How often was it worth that? Could you have just written it up
instead? Be mindful of the costs and tradeoffs.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing solidifies, chat dissolves. Substantial decisions start
and end with an exchange of complete thoughts, not one-line-at-a-time
jousts. If it’s important, critical, or fundamental, write it up, don’t
chat it down.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking only helps who’s in the room, writing helps everyone.
This includes people who couldn’t make it, or future employees who join
years from now.</p></li>
<li><p>Never expect or require someone to get back to you immediately
unless it’s a true emergency. The expectation of immediate response is
toxic.</p></li>
<li><p>Urgency is overrated, ASAP is poison.</p></li>
<li><p>If something’s going to be difficult to hear or share, invite
questions at the end. Ending without the invitation will lead to public
silence but private conjecture. This is where rumors breed.</p></li>
<li><p>The end of the day has a way of convincing you what you’ve done
is good, but the next morning has a way of telling you the truth. If you
aren’t sure, sleep on it before saying it.</p></li>
</ul>
