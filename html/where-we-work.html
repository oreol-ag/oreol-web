<p>At <em>Oreol,</em> we prioritize employee flexibility and
<strong>support remote work.</strong> Our employees have two primary
options:</p>
<h2 id="from-home.">From home.</h2>
<p>The majority of our team members at <em>Oreol</em> choose to work
from home for the majority of their work time. We understand the
importance of a comfortable and efficient home office setup, which is
why we offer a generous allowance during your first year with us. This
allowance can be used to equip and personalize your home office to meet
your needs.</p>
<h2 id="from-a-coworking-space.">From a coworking space.</h2>
<p>For those who prefer a different workspace or find working from home
less suitable, we also offer the option of working from a coworking
space. Oreol provides a resonable stipend per month to support your desk
rental in a coworking environment.</p>
