<h3 id="swiss-federal-pension-fund-publica.">Swiss Federal Pension Fund
PUBLICA.</h3>
<p><strong>Our employees are members of the Swiss Federal Pension Fund
PUBLICA,</strong> which plays a pivotal role in securing your financial
future and retirement planning. When your journey with <em>Oreol</em>
comes to an end, you will have several options regarding your vested
benefits, including the transfer of funds to a new employer’s pension

<h3 id="employee-profit-sharing.">Employee profit sharing.</h3>
<p><strong><em>Oreol</em> shares 10% of its annual company profits with
employees, which is distributed in shares based on tenure.</strong>
Profits are distributed after the books are closed on the previous
fiscal year, typically around March (e.g., 2023 profits distributed in
March 2024). You’re eligible to participate in profit sharing
<strong>after two years of working at <em>Oreol.</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="paid-time-off.">Paid time off.</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Vacation time:</strong> <em>Oreol</em> employees receive
<strong>five weeks of annual holiday,</strong> which must be taken
within the same year. They can carry over up to two weeks into the next
year, but these days should be used by March 31st. The timing of
holidays should be <strong>coordinated with supervisors based on
operational requirements.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sick time:</strong> We maintain a flexible approach to
sick time that prioritizes your well-being. <strong>We don’t operate
with a formal bank of sick days, nor do we require you to keep track of
your sick days.</strong> However if you’re unexpectedly away from work
due to illness or injury for more than 5 consecutive work days, you’ll
transition from sick time to Personal Leave. Your manager will check in
with you if you’re consistently taking 3+ unplanned sick days per month.
<strong>Excessive use of sick time may result in disciplinary
measures.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Personal leave:</strong> If you are unable to work due to
illness or injury for more than one week, please promptly notify your
manager. <strong>You can take four weeks off at full pay, followed by
eight weeks at 70% pay.</strong> After 12 weeks, we’ll discuss your
situation on a case-by-case basis. In some cases, you may be required to
provide medical documentation to support your request. It’s important to
note that Personal Leave is limited to one instance of paid leave within
a 12-month period.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summer hours:</strong> Every year from May 1 through
August 31, we implement a 4-day work week. To be eligible, new employees
may need to complete a training program as advised by their team lead.
If a holiday falls during summer hours, you can choose to take the
holiday off or your regular summer day off. Any additional days off
beyond this would be considered vacation days.</p></li>
</ul>

<strong>Revolut Business credit card</strong> that you can use for work
expenses for software, computer equipment, meet-up travel, or office
