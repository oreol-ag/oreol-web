<p><em>Oreol</em> strongly supports and encourages <strong>remote and
asynchronous work,</strong> which comes with specific rights and
responsibilities to ensure a smooth and productive work experience.
Adherence to our communication guidelines and working methodology is
crucial.</p>

equipment.</p>
<p>The book <em>REMOTEâ€”Office not requiered</em> (Jason Fried and David
Heinemeier Hansson, https://basecamp.com/books/remote) is recommended

<h2 id="working-hours.">Working hours.</h2>
<p><strong>We do not formally track over hours or define an overtime
budget.</strong> However, we acknowledge that at times, operational
needs may necessitate employees to work beyond their standard hours. In
alignment with our commitment to promoting a healthy work-life balance,
we encourage everyone to consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Respect for working hours:</strong> Although remote work
offers flexibility, employees are required to adhere to the schedules
agreed upon with their teams. Punctuality in virtual meetings and
collaboration is important.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>As a rule of thumb, full-time employees standard working
hours are 41 hours per week.</strong> These hours are designed to meet
the operational needs of the organization while considering the
well-being and productivity of our workforce.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Balancing work and personal life:</strong> You should
avoid to work extra hours beyond the legal limit of 45 hours per week.
We encourage employees to strive for a balance by taking equivalent time
as soon as they can.</p></li>

technology.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data security:</strong> Protecting sensitive company
information is paramount. Employees must follow our data security
policies and adhere to best practices for securing data, devices, and
communication channels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Appropriate use of technology:</strong> Employees are
expected to use company-provided technology and software for
work-related tasks. Personal technology should not be used unless
authorized by the IT department.</p></li>
