<p>Oreol strongly supports and encourages <strong>remote and
asynchronous work,</strong> which comes with specific rights and
responsibilities to ensure a smooth and productive work experience.
Adherence to our communication guidelines and working methodology is
crucial.</p>
<h2 id="remote.">REMOTE.</h2>
<p>Employees are responsible for setting up a <strong>productive and
safe remote work environment.</strong> This includes having a stable
internet connection, a dedicated workspace, and the necessary tools and
equipment.</p>
<h2 id="communication-guidelines-and-methodology.">Communication
guidelines and methodology.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Adherence to communication guidelines:</strong> Remote
work relies heavily on effective communication. Employees are expected
to follow our communication guidelines diligently. This includes timely
responses to messages, the use of appropriate communication tools (such
as Basecamp and Shape Up), and respectful and professional
interactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Utilization of Basecamp:</strong> We use Basecamp as our
primary project management and communication platform. All employees
should be proficient in using Basecamp for project tracking, task
management, and team collaboration. Regular check-ins and project
updates are essential.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Embracing the Shape Up methodology:</strong> At Oreol, we
follow the Shape Up methodology for project development. Familiarity
with Shape Up concepts and participation in the process is expected.
This methodology helps ensure efficient project management and
successful outcomes.</p></li>

<h2 id="working-hours.">Working hours.</h2>
<p>We employ the annual working time model to provide flexibility and
adaptable working conditions that consider the personal needs of our
employees. This model allows for the optimization of work-life
balance.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Respect for working hours:</strong> Although remote work
offers flexibility, employees are required to adhere to the defined
working hours and schedules agreed upon with their teams. Punctuality in
virtual meetings and collaboration is important. <strong>Our standard
working hours for full-time employees are set at 41 hours per
week.</strong> These hours are designed to meet the operational needs of
the organization while considering the well-being and productivity of
our workforce.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Balancing work and personal life:</strong> Remote work
allows for flexibility in managing personal commitments. Employees are
encouraged to maintain a healthy work-life balance and to communicate
proactively with their teams if they need to adjust their
schedules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Over-hours and overtime:</strong> We understand that
occasionally, operational demands may require employees to work beyond
the standard hours. To address this, we have established a policy on
over-hours and overtime. <strong>Over-hours refer to extra hours worked
beyond the legal limit of 45 hours per week.</strong> We encourage
employees to strive for a balance by taking equivalent time off
throughout the year. In cases where balancing over-hours with time off
is not feasible due to work needs, <strong>employees are permitted to
carry over up to 100 hours to the following year.</strong> An additional
100 hours can be compensated. However, hours exceeding this limit will
neither be carried over nor compensated.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-security-and-technology.">Data security and
technology.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data security:</strong> Protecting sensitive company
information is paramount. Employees must follow our data security
policies and adhere to best practices for securing data, devices, and
communication channels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Appropriate use of technology:</strong> Employees are
expected to use company-provided technology and software for
work-related tasks. Personal technology should not be used unless
authorized by the IT department.</p></li>
</ul>
