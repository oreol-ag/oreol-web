<h2 id="agile.">Agile.</h2>
<p>Agile is an iterative project management and software development
approach that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and
with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a long-term
launch, an agile team provides work in small but consumable increments.
Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously, so teams
have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly. Frameworks
such as Scrum, <strong>Shape Up or DevOps</strong> are considered part
of Agile methodologies.</p>
<h2 id="devops.">DevOps.</h2>
<p>DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev)
and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life
cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
Several DevOps aspects came from the Agile methodology.</p>
<h2 id="heterogenous-computing.">Heterogenous computing.</h2>
<p>Heterogeneous computing refers to using multiple processing units
(such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ACAPs) to leverage the unique strengths
of each type of processing unit to achieve better performance and
efficiency than would be possible with a single kind of unit alone. By
combining multiple processing units with different architectures and
capabilities, a heterogeneous computing system can handle a broader
range of workloads and optimize performance for each task. Heterogeneous
computing is becoming increasingly popular in fields like artificial
intelligence, scientific computing, and high-performance computing.</p>
<h2 id="shape-up.">Shape Up.</h2>
<p>As described in <strong>How we work,</strong> many of our practices
are heavily influenced by Basecamp—the tool we use for project
management and company communications—and the work methodology they
enforce, known as Shape Up. For more information, you can explore their
free book on <a
