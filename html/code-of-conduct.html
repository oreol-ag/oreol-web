<p>At <em>Oreol,</em> we are committed to fostering a <strong>healthy
and inclusive work environment.</strong> To achieve this, weâ€™ve
established a set of guidelines for employee behavior. <strong>We will
recognize as positive behavior:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using respectful and courteous language when communicating.</li>
<li>Demonstrating empathy, especially when addressing diverse viewpoints
and experiences.</li>
<li>Embracing constructive criticism and direct feedback, and providing
it with a spirit of improvement.</li>
<li>Operating with a default of trust and positivity, assuming good
intentions in work relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>the following behaviors are considered
unacceptable:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The use of any language or imagery that is sexualized or violent in
nature.</li>
<li>Making unwelcome sexual advances or providing unwanted sexual
attention.</li>
<li>Engaging in any form of discrimination or harassment, especially on
the basis of protected characteristics such as race, color, religion,
sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability,
marital status, citizenship, national origin, genetic information, or
any other characteristic protected by law.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reporting.">Reporting.</h2>
<p><strong>If you encounter or witness any behavior that contravenes our
Code of Conduct, we encourage you to report it promptly.</strong> You
can make a report to your manager or directly to the leadership team via
email or chat. Rest assured, all reports will be carefully reviewed and
thoroughly investigated. We prioritize your
<strong>confidentiality</strong> and will protect it to the extent
possible during the investigation.</p>
<h2 id="consequences-of-violations.">Consequences of violations.</h2>
<p>Should an employee be found in breach of our Code of Conduct,
<strong>the violation will be permanently recorded in their personnel
file.</strong> The severity of the offense and the results of the
investigation will determine the appropriate response. This may include
mandatory training, an official reprimand, or, in extreme cases,
termination of employment. We aim to communicate any actions taken in
response to the reported violation to the individual who reported it,
when feasible.</p>
