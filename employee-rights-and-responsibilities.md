*Oreol* strongly supports and encourages **remote and asynchronous work,** which comes with specific rights and responsibilities to ensure a smooth and productive work experience. Adherence to our communication guidelines and working methodology is crucial.

## Working remotely.
Employees are responsible for setting up a **productive and safe remote work environment.** This includes having a stable internet connection, a dedicated workspace, and the necessary tools and equipment.

The book *REMOTEâ€”Office not requiered* (Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, [https://basecamp.com/books/remote](https://basecamp.com/books/remote)) is recommended for reference or further study. 

## Communication guidelines and methodology.

* **Adherence to communication guidelines:** Remote work relies heavily on effective communication. Employees are expected to follow our communication guidelines diligently and **practicing clear communication.**

* **Utilization of Basecamp:** We use Basecamp as our primary project management and communication platform. All employees should be proficient in using Basecamp for project tracking, task management, and team collaboration. Regular check-ins and project updates are essential.

* **Embracing the Shape Up methodology:** At *Oreol,* we follow the Shape Up methodology for project development. Familiarity with Shape Up concepts and participation in the process is expected. This methodology helps ensure efficient project management and successful outcomes **every six weeks.**

## Working hours.
**We do not formally track over hours or define an overtime budget.** However, we acknowledge that at times, operational needs may necessitate employees to work beyond their standard hours. In alignment with our commitment to promoting a healthy work-life balance, we encourage everyone to consider the following:

* **Respect for working hours:** Although remote work offers flexibility, employees are required to adhere to the schedules agreed upon with their teams. Punctuality in virtual meetings and collaboration is important. 

* **As a rule of thumb, full-time employees standard working hours are 41 hours per week.** These hours are designed to meet the operational needs of the organization while considering the well-being and productivity of our workforce.

* **Balancing work and personal life:** You should avoid to work extra hours beyond the legal limit of 45 hours per week. We encourage employees to strive for a balance by taking equivalent time as soon as they can.

## Data security and technology.

* **Data security:** Protecting sensitive company information is paramount. Employees must follow our data security policies and adhere to best practices for securing data, devices, and communication channels.

* **Appropriate use of technology:** Employees are expected to use company-provided technology and software for work-related tasks. Personal technology should not be used unless authorized by the IT department.
