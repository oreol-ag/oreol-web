# What we do and stand for
We are a company **dedicated to providing advanced computing technologies,** empowering specialized hardware engineers, data scientists, and research institutions. 

**Our vision is best represented by Hyperion,** an on-premises acceleration platform that streamlines the development of complex acceleration applications by combining modern energy-efficient multi-core servers, reconfigurable and specialized processors, and a customized RunTime.

## Values

These **shared values** are the foundation for unity and alignment in our company.

### Walk the walk
Your actions carry weight, and they have the power to inspire others. Your conduct sets the standard, shaping the behavior of those around you to reflect the values and principles you embody.
    
### Be honest
Honesty and open communication are indispensable. Transparency in your actions fosters collaboration and facilitates timely conflict resolution.

### Have confidence
We have faith in your judgment. Trust your instincts; your intuition and decision-making abilities are valuable assets that can lead to innovative solutions.
    
### Prioritize quality 
Choose quality over quantity. Focus on crafting fewer, outstanding creations that resonate, rather than churning out a multitude of average ones.

### Embrace your inner artist
Beauty isn't confined solely to art; it permeates our everyday tasks and work. Everything we undertake should not only be functional but also exude beauty.
