    <h2 id="agile.">Agile.</h2>
    <p class="content">Agile is an iterative project management and software development
    approach that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and
    with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a long-term
    launch, an agile team provides work in small but consumable increments.
    Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously, so teams
    have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly. Frameworks
    such as DevOps, Kanban, Scrum, or Shape Up are considered part of Agile
    methodologies.</p>
    <h2 id="devops.">DevOps.</h2>
    <p class="content">DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev)
    and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life
    cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
    Several DevOps aspects came from the Agile methodology.</p>
    <h2 id="heterogenous-computing.">Heterogenous computing.</h2>
    <p class="content">Heterogeneous computing refers to using multiple processing units
    (such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ACAPs) to leverage the unique strengths
    of each type of processing unit to achieve better performance and
    efficiency than would be possible with a single kind of unit alone. By
    combining multiple processing units with different architectures and
    capabilities, a heterogeneous computing system can handle a broader
    range of workloads and optimize performance for each task. Heterogeneous
    computing is becoming increasingly popular in fields like artificial
    intelligence, scientific computing, and high-performance computing.</p>
    <h2 id="shape-up.">Shape Up.</h2>
    <p class="content">Shape Up is not a traditional Agile methodology like Scrum or Kanban.
    It’s actually a product development framework introduced by Basecamp, a
    software development company. Shape Up is designed to help teams build
    and ship software products efficiently and in a way that encourages
    innovation and quality. Here’s a summary of the key principles and
    practices of Shape Up:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p class="content"><strong>Fixed time and flexible scope:</strong> Development cycles
    have a fixed timeline, typically six weeks, with a flexible scope that
    is adjusted to fit within the time frame.</p></li>
    <li><p class="content"><strong>No Sprint Planning or Daily Standups:</strong> Shape Up
    avoids traditional Agile meetings like sprint planning and daily
    standups, instead relying on written communication to share updates and
    decisions.</p></li>
    <li><p class="content"><strong>Two Tracks:</strong> Shape Up operates with two tracks—the
    shaping track for creating “Pitches,” and the building track for
    implementing the selected projects or “bets.”</p></li>
    <li><p class="content"><strong>Shaping:</strong> During the shaping phase, a group of more
    senior individuals produces a collection of document (“Pitches”) that
    serves as a detailed proposal for the work to be done in the next cycle.
    This includes descriptions, wireframes, and high-level designs.</p></li>
    <li><p class="content"><strong>Betting Table:</strong> The Betting Table, consisting of
    various stakeholders, selects or <em>bet on</em> projects from the
    shaped proposals or “Pitches” based on their interest and potential
    impact.</p></li>
    <li><p class="content"><strong>Building:</strong> Once projects are selected, the “makers”
    have a fixed amount of time, typically six weeks, to build the
    feature.</p></li>
    <li><p class="content"><strong>Over hours:</strong> Basecamp promotes a healthy work-life
    balance, so team members aren’t expected to work overtime. Unfinished
    work within the six-week timeframe is considered a failure, and teams
    move on to the next project.</p></li>
    <li><p class="content"><strong>Rest and recovery:</strong> After each development cycle,
    there’s a “cool-down” or “rest and recovery” period for team members to
    address technical debt, perform maintenance, or engage in activities of
    their choice.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="content">The book <em>Shape Up—Stop running in circles and ship work that
    matters</em> (Ryan Singer, https://basecamp.com/books/shapeup) is
    recommended for reference or further study.</p>
