    <h1>Compensation and Benefits</h1>

    <p class="content"><em>Oreol</em> provides its employees with stimulating work and an
    excellent work-life balance, expecting them in return to deliver
    outstanding performance.</p>
    <h2 id="compensation.">Compensation.</h2>
    <p class="content">We maintain a <strong>uniform salary structure</strong> for employees
    in the same position, regardless of their work location. We are fully
    dedicated to promoting fairness and equality in our compensation
    practices, and your salary will be determined by your <strong>category
    within the Mastery Path.</strong> The salary baselines adhere to the
    <strong>Swiss Federal Personnel Act</strong> and the <strong>Canton of
    Lucerne Personnel Ordinance.</strong></p>
    <h2 id="benefits.">Benefits.</h2>
    <p class="content">Our comprehensive benefits package is designed to support your
    physical and financial health, ensuring you have access to a range of
    valuable perks and resources to enhance your overall quality of
    life.</p>
    <h3 id="swiss-federal-pension-fund-publica.">Swiss Federal Pension Fund
    PUBLICA.</h3>
    <p class="content"><strong>Our employees are members of the Swiss Federal Pension Fund
    PUBLICA,</strong> which plays a pivotal role in securing your financial
    future and retirement planning. When your journey with <em>Oreol</em>
    comes to an end, you will have several options regarding your vested
    benefits, including the transfer of funds to a new employer’s pension
    fund, opening a vested benefits account, or applying for a cash
    payment.</p>
    <h3 id="employee-profit-sharing.">Employee profit sharing.</h3>
    <p class="content"><strong><em>Oreol</em> shares 10% of its annual company profits with
    employees, which is distributed in shares based on tenure.</strong>
    Profits are distributed after the books are closed on the previous
    fiscal year, typically around March (e.g., 2023 profits distributed in
    March 2024). You’re eligible to participate in profit sharing
    <strong>after two years of working at <em>Oreol.</em></strong></p>
    <h3 id="paid-time-off.">Paid time off.</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><p class="content"><strong>Vacation time:</strong> <em>Oreol</em> employees receive
    <strong>five weeks of annual holiday,</strong> which must be taken
    within the same year. They can carry over up to two weeks into the next
    year, but these days should be used by March 31st. The timing of
    holidays should be <strong>coordinated with supervisors based on
    operational requirements.</strong></p></li>
    <li><p class="content"><strong>Sick time:</strong> We maintain a flexible approach to
    sick time that prioritizes your well-being. <strong>We don’t operate
    with a formal bank of sick days, nor do we require you to keep track of
    your sick days.</strong> However if you’re unexpectedly away from work
    due to illness or injury for more than 5 consecutive work days, you’ll
    transition from sick time to Personal Leave. Your manager will check in
    with you if you’re consistently taking 3+ unplanned sick days per month.
    <strong>Excessive use of sick time may result in disciplinary
    measures.</strong></p></li>
    <li><p class="content"><strong>Personal leave:</strong> If you are unable to work due to
    illness or injury for more than one week, please promptly notify your
    manager. <strong>You can take four weeks off at full pay, followed by
    eight weeks at 70% pay.</strong> After 12 weeks, we’ll discuss your
    situation on a case-by-case basis. In some cases, you may be required to
    provide medical documentation to support your request. It’s important to
    note that Personal Leave is limited to one instance of paid leave within
    a 12-month period.</p></li>
    <li><p class="content"><strong>Summer hours:</strong> Every year from May 1 through
    August 31, we implement a 4-day work week. To be eligible, new employees
    may need to complete a training program as advised by their team lead.
    If a holiday falls during summer hours, you can choose to take the
    holiday off or your regular summer day off. Any additional days off
    beyond this would be considered vacation days.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="personal-accounts.">Personal accounts.</h3>
    <p class="content">As an <em>Oreol</em> employee, you’ll receive a comprehensive set of
    accounts to support your work and financial needs. This includes a
    <strong>Basecamp</strong> account for project management, a
    <strong>HEY</strong> email account, and a <strong>Dropbox</strong>
    account for file storage. Additionally, you will receive a
    <strong>Revolut Business credit card</strong> that you can use for work
    expenses for software, computer equipment, meet-up travel, or office
    supplies.</p>
    <h3 id="continuous-education.">Continuous education.</h3>
    <p class="content">We believe in the importance of continuous learning and skill
    enhancement. To support our employees’ professional growth, <strong>we
    offer funding opportunities for courses and training programs</strong>
    aimed at improving their skills and expertise.</p>
    <h3 id="active-lifestyle-support.">Active lifestyle support.</h3>
    <p class="content">We value your well-being and encourage an active lifestyle and we’re
    committed to helping you stay fit and healthy. That’s why <strong>we’re
    happy to cover half the cost of your sports subscription,</strong>
