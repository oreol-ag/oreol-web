# Hyperion

The following are frequently asked questions about **Hyperion.** To get to know more about it, please follow [this link.](https://github.com/oreol-ag/hyperion-web)

## What is Hyperion?
Hyperion is a ready-to-use acceleration platform combining energy-efficient servers with advanced acceleration devices such as ACAPs, FPGAs, multi-core CPUs, and GPUs. It also includes a customized command-line interpreter (CLI) and an API, bundled as Hyperion RunTime (HRT), for seamless management and programming of these devices.

## Who is Hyperion intended for? 
Hyperion is created to simplify the process of developing complex acceleration applications, primarily serving highly specialized acceleration engineers working at research institutions or universities. These engineers typically benefit from dedicated on-site hardware for development, testing, and staging before transitioning to production.

## Is Hyperion hosted in the public cloud? 
No, Hyperion is designed to be an on-premises resource for edge computing. However, you have the option to build your private cloud using Hyperion servers and offer your accelerated services by exposing them.

## How can I begin using Hyperion? 
You can get started by trying out a few Hyperion instances available online for free evaluation. Simply sign in here to give it a try.

## How can I purchase Hyperion? 
To obtain Hyperion instances, please complete this form, and our sales department will reach out to you shortly.

## How are my Hyperion instances maintained? 
Hyperion is a managed platform, allowing us to provide remote maintenance for your Hyperion servers. We ensure the health and keep them up-to-date, including the operating system, acceleration development tools, and the devices themselves.

## How do I  build accelerated applications on Hyperion? 
Hyperion includes Hyperion RunTime (HRT), featuring a CLI and an API. The command-line interpreter assists in building customized accelerated applications—tailored to your Hyperion instance's underlying hardware—and sets up the infrastructure accordingly. Additionally, the API streamlines development, allowing seamless utilization of all exposed devices (ACAPs, FPGAs, multi-core CPUs, and GPUs) in your source code.

<!-- ## What is HRT? 
HRT is the RunTime software specifically designed for Hyperion to efficiently manage and interact with its acceleration devices. Additionally, HRT assists Hyperion users in creating new accelerated applications, and provides an API for common operations like data transfer and scheduling. Please refer to the About HRT section to learn more about it. 

## How can I purchase HRT? 
How can I purchase HRT? HRT is open source, but it follows a Commercial Open Source model, where certain additional features and benefits are exclusively available to customers who purchase Hyperion. 

## Does Oreol offer consulting services for developing my accelerated applications? 
No, Oreol focuses in designing, configuring, and maintaining your Hyperion cluster to meet your application's specific requirements, rather than providing assistance with application development. -->
